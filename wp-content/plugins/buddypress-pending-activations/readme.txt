etivite is the orginal developer of this plugin. He handed off ownership to me and I've completely rebuilt it, but kept some of the core work he did. Thans for the great work you did, etivite! 

This plugin will NOT work for a multisite/network WordPress install - intended for single WordPress ONLY - for the moment.

== Installation ==
